> A fully automated bash script to install **MetaTrader 5** (MT5) on Arch Linux using **Wine Staging**.

## ⚠️ Warning: Uses Wine-Staging

This script uses `wine-staging`, the **experimental** branch of Wine. It includes bleeding-edge patches that may offer **better compatibility** but **may also cause instability**. Use with caution if you rely on a stable Wine environment.

## 📦 Dependencies

The following packages will be installed if not already present:

| Package        | Purpose                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `wine-staging` | Runs Windows applications on Linux         |
| `wine-gecko`   | Adds Internet Explorer rendering support   |
| `winetricks`   | Helps install DLLs, fonts, and tweaks      |
| `wget`         | Used to download the MT5 installer         |
| `figlet`       | Fancy terminal banners (optional)          |
| `lolcat`       | Rainbow-colored terminal output (optional) |

> 🛠 Already installed packages will **not** be reinstalled.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashish-Kushwaha/MetaTrader5_archLinux.git
cd MetaTrader5_archLinux
chmod +x mt5archlinux.sh
```

### 2. Run the Script

./mt5archlinux.sh
```

## 🔍 What This Script Does

1. **Checks internet connectivity**
2. **Installs required dependencies**
3. **Sets up an isolated Wine prefix** at `~/.wine_mt5`
4. **Downloads the MT5 installer**
5. **Launches the installer** using Wine

## 🏁 After Installation

You can run MetaTrader 5 anytime using:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/.wine_mt5 wine "$HOME/.wine_mt5/drive_c/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/terminal64.exe"
```

## 🧹 Uninstallation

To remove MetaTrader 5 and the Wine environment:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.wine_mt5 mt5setup.exe
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── mt5archlinux.sh          # Main installer script
├── mt5setup.exe             # (Downloaded) MT5 installer
└── ~/.wine_mt5              # Wine prefix containing MT5
```

## 🤖 Customization Ideas

- Use `Misc/mt5arch.sh` for an advanced installation including WebView2 and Desktop entry creation.
- Automatically launch MT5 after install.
- Customize Wine settings via `winecfg`.
